## Recommendations

**1. Evaluation of the customer journey from introduction to conversion is warranted. We may want to leverage our analytics attribution models to understand if users are being introduced and converted on single channels.**

**2. We may be overleveraged on organic because if these are generic keywords, we can lose the traffic with a Google algorithm update. We should use Google Search Console to understand our keyword intent.**

**3. We need to have a clear understanding of what optimization were done during the first 3months of the campaign. If we can reproduce them,we can extend the productive period of the campaign.**
